Thanks for taking the time to explore my website

Im 37 graduated with an Associates in Engineering from Glendale Community College. 
Ive recently started a cleaning business and i gotta say i dont regret it. I decided to join the world of coding 
because i think it would be a great fit for my future. I live in Phoenix, AZ with my wife and son.
